- I actively use git intergrations in every line of code i write, so everything is instantly committed to certain repos im working so please don't excpect all of them to be properly organized and complied.
- I'd like to keep this sandbox account anonymous, so no issues/following/pulls/contributions pls.
- The contents under [portenacode](https://github.com/orgs/portenacode/) is stricly licenced under international IP laws.
- These repositories contain my personal projects I built to solve my own problems along with some documentation and are not intended for commercial/community use. Please follow my alt. account for projects for Open Source.
